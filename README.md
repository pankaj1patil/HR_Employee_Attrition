# HR_Employee_Attrition
We have constructed a very simple pipeline of predicting employee attrition, from some basic Exploratory Data Analysis to feature engineering as well as implementing one learning model in the form of a Logistic Regression model. This entire notebook takes less than a minute to run and it actually returns a 90% accuracy in its predictions.
